This folder serves as example for handling your code build stages in your codepipline

### Buildspecs
 A build spec is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. 

 * build : build artifact
 * plan : plan test env
 * deploy : deploy test env
 * acceptance: run acceptance test on test env
 * postacceptance: clean up test env
 * tag: version tag your build
     * this build spec takes an env var GIT_REPO which should be set to your core code repo generated by your pipeline code
 * deliver: release a verision to s3
     * this build spec takes two env vars
         * GIT_REPO: Your deploy Repo generated by your pipeline code
         * RELEASE_BUCKET: bucket where the relase is sent this is also generate by your pipeline code


## Make

The make files also include tagging and releasing commands.

## Scripts
* version.sh
    * Is ran by your build spec inside of docker in order to tag your code
* release.sh
